The plan here is to create a number bucket class that provides
both dynamic allocation and a LIFO file structure
as such, the last element to be pushed on to the number bucket
should be the first element that is popped from it
isEmpty() should return true when there is no elements left in the bucket
get_size() should return the number of elements in the bucket
top() should provide the element that would be popped from the bucket
push() should should take the provided element and push it on to the bucket
pop() should remove the topmost element from the bucket
there should also be a reasonable number of tests verifying
functionality of the underlying numberbucket
