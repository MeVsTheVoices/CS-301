<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Given this is a more complicated algorithm, I went ahead and tested extensively</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unit tests are given for almost every function within the implementation of the Trotter algorithm</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These were built upon, first checking that we could generate a set of numbers</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then that we’d find the correct largest mobile</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then that this mobile was swapped correctly</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then that all the larger elements than that were reversed in direction</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then that a single iteration of the algorithm would execute correctly on a small set of test cases</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lastly, the functionality that combines all these together was tested extensively</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It tests that the correct number of permutations are generated,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that these permutations are individually unique,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And that these permutations contain nothing but the originally generated elements</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The submitted project listing contains all permutations<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[ [1, 2, 3],</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>[1, 2, 3, 4],</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>[1, 2, …, 5],</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>[1, 2, …, 6],</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It can happily go higher, but, at this point we’re generating 5000 some permutations, and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Project listing would likely balloon in size were we to go higher and include these</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Each checks out as specified and as can be seen in the assertions written in the unit tests</span></p>
