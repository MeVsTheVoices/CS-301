We're creating a unsorted list that can be inserted into, retrieved from, and deleted from
the idea I'm going with is to use a std map of std functions
each entry in the map has an associated name
that name is used to look up the command in the map and its associated function
that function is then executed and its results returned as a string
this string is then shown to the user and saved in to the output file
the specification also states a few other necessary features of the list implementation
such as the commands it must accept, and the ceiling, the maximum number of elements it can contain
